# The-Odin-Prject-Landing-Page

This is required project once we finish the flexbox part in the odin project. they give us two images they are in the assets folder that contain the desired result, is not mandatory to be the same colors or fonts. is just to give us an idea of the estructure we need to make. 

While doing this i've been looking for more information, learning from Youtube videos, using the oding project as a index, i consumed the odin project content and i Reinforce my learning with others source. i'm not an expert or similar, i will try to be as much semantic as i can (i've learned a bit about semantic in others source) but as i said i'm not expert so probably i will make some  mistakes and is totally ok, this project is to learn. thanks!

NOTE: i speak spanish, i studied english when i was in hight school so doing this in english, with english content will add a bit of dificulty but im excited and i'm ok with it. this is a challenge for me!!
